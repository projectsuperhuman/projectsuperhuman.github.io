  <h1>Audacious Projects</h1>
  <p>Exploring bold ideas to push the boundaries of AI+Human collaboration.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Build a Text-to-Voice App</h2>
    <p>
      Goal: Create a text-to-voice application using Google's free API. This app will convert user-provided text into natural-sounding speech, making text content more accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why This Matters: Text-to-voice technology enhances inclusivity and opens up new possibilities for accessibility in content consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Current Status: Researching the Google Text-to-Speech API and identifying use cases.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Build an Agent Using DeepSeek R1 API</h2>
    <p>
      Goal: Build an agent that leverages the DeepSeek R1 API to validate the theory that reasoning-model APIs lead to better decision-making agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why This Matters: If successful, this project could demonstrate how reasoning models enhance the effectiveness and reliability of AI agents in complex problem-solving scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
      Current Status: Initial exploration of DeepSeek R1 API capabilities and creating a proof-of-concept agent.
